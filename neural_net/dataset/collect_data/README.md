# Dataset Collection

A simple, static webpage will be used to collect recordings of DGS-signs performed by team members using their webcam.

The videos must be labeled with their respective sign and will then be processed using the [mediapipe hand pose detection](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/hands.html).
