# Keras Neural Network

A neural network, detecting DGS-signs represented by hand pose vectors is designed and evaluated using Keras in Jupyter Notebooks.

To run the Jupyter Notebooks make sure [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/index.html) is installed on your system.

The noteboks can be run either by using Anaconda's Jupyter Notebooks directly or in VsCode by selecting your Conda Evironment in the notebook.

## Model Training

The model is trained in the [train_neural_net notebook](./train_neural_net.ipynb). The dataset is imported and converted in the same notebook.

## Model Evaluation

The model is evaluated in the [evaluate_neural_net notebook](./evaluate_neural_net.ipynb).
